# Resistor detection

This package contains the software to determine the value of a resistor based on an image. The images were taken using an IDS U3-3280CP-C-HQ Rev 2.2 color camera wit a resolution of 2448 x 2048 (5MP) and a USB3.0 interface. A Rihoh FL-CC1614-5M 16mm lens was used and an IDS5-00-250-1-W-24V white dome light was used for illumination.
