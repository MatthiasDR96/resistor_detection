# Resistor detection

In this set of notebooks, the value of a resistor is determined using a colour camera, some basic image processing techniques, and a Support Vector Machine as a classifier. 

The first notebook 'Data analysis' loops over all images and displays the labels. The second notebook 'Data preprocessing' shows all the image processing steps to obtain the color bands of a resistor from an image. The third script 'Model training' trains a Support Vector Machine on the dataset and outputs a model. The last script 'Model validation' makes predictions for the whole dataset and computes a total accuracy.
